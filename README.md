# UC Merced Classification using Deep Learning

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a deep learning model that can classify images based on land use in the image.

## Dataset
The dataset we used in this project is provided by
- [UC Merced](http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html)


## Used Libraries
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Flask
- Flask_ngrok
- Sklearn

## Notebooks
- [```KMMI_UCMERCED_Land_Use_Classification.ipynb```](https://github.com/rdfnz/UC_Merced-land-use-classification/blob/main/KMMI_UCMERCED_Land_Use_Classification.ipynb) - Build model using basic CNN, Transfer Learning (VGG16, MobileNet, InceptionV3)
- [```KMMI_Land_Use_Deployment_using_Flask.ipynb```](https://github.com/rdfnz/UC_Merced-land-use-classification/blob/main/KMMI_Land_Use_Deployment_using_Flask.ipynb) - Deploy model with Flask and Flask_ngrok in google colab
